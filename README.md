## About
Travel Diary is a demonstration app meant to summarize some of my RoR and React skills as well as investigate OAuth login with Google. It allows users to create their own diary with travel experiences.  <br />
The functionality includes logging with Google credentials ang managing entries (creating, updating, deleting and listing).  <br />
While creating a new entry the current weather is automatically fetched from external API (<a href='https://www.visualcrossing.com'>https://www.visualcrossing.com</a>).
